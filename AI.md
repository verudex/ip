INCREMENT : AI USAGE
A-Enums : Used Claude AI to refactor my code to include the usage of enums for TaskType and Command Type. Saved a lot of time in refactoring the original code in Parser.java, since the logic is still the same as before, just that now the processing of each command type is split into its own respective method.
A-JUnit : Used Claude AI to generate JUnit tests for my chatbot by prompting what features need to be tested and what loopholes could possibly be exploited by the user.
A-JavaDoc : Used Claude AI to generate JavaDoc comments for non-private classes/methods.
Level-10 : Used Claude AI to copy over and repurpose code from parser.java to work with the new GUI I/O instead. Also, used Claude AI to implement the "close GUI upon user input of 'Bye'" functionality.
